Let me explain the system architecture and each component's role:

## **üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview**

### **1. The Target System (Zypher Research Team)**
**Location:** `target_system/zypher_research_team.ts`

**What it does:**
- **CoreSpeed Zypher Agent** - A sophisticated AI agent built with CoreSpeed's proprietary framework
- **Anthropic Claude Integration** - Uses `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` for AI reasoning
- **Multi-Agent Research** - Simulates a research team that can:
  - Analyze complex queries
  - Generate comprehensive reports
  - Handle different types of research tasks

**Role in Demo:**
- This is the "patient" that AHA monitors
- It performs real AI research tasks
- When it fails, AHA detects and diagnoses the issue

### **2. The Test Script (Integration Layer)**
**Location:** `test_zypher_with_langsmith.py`

**What it does:**
- **Orchestrates the Zypher system** - Runs the TypeScript agent from Python
- **LangSmith Integration** - Sets up tracing so all agent actions are logged
- **Environment Management** - Ensures all API keys and settings are passed correctly
- **Error Handling** - Captures and reports any failures

**Role in Demo:**
- Acts as the "launcher" for the target system
- Ensures LangSmith can observe everything the agent does
- Provides structured output for AHA to analyze

### **3. LangSmith (Observability Platform)**
**What it does:**
- **Traces all agent actions** - Records every step the Zypher agent takes
- **Stores execution data** - Keeps detailed logs of inputs, outputs, and errors
- **Provides webhooks** - Can notify AHA when failures occur
- **Project Organization** - Groups related traces together

**Role in Demo:**
- The "nervous system" that monitors the target system
- Provides the data that AHA needs to diagnose issues
- Enables real-time failure detection

### **4. AHA (Autonomous AI Healing Agent)**
**Location:** `backend/` and `frontend/`

**What it does:**
- **Failure Detection** - Receives webhooks from LangSmith when errors occur
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Uses Claude to analyze what went wrong
- **Autonomous Action** - Creates GitHub issues with diagnosis and fixes
- **Incident Management** - Tracks all failures in a dashboard

**Role in Demo:**
- The "doctor" that heals the target system
- Demonstrates autonomous problem-solving
- Shows how AI can manage AI systems

## **üîÑ The Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: Target System Execution**
```bash
python3 test_zypher_with_langsmith.py "Research AI trends"
```

**What happens:**
1. **Test script** sets up LangSmith tracing
2. **Zypher agent** receives the research query
3. **Claude AI** processes the query and generates research
4. **LangSmith** records every action and response
5. **Results** are returned to the test script

### **Step 2: Failure Detection (Simulated)**
```bash
python3 run_complete_aha_demo.py "Research query"
```

**What happens:**
1. **Target system** runs (may succeed or fail)
2. **Simulated webhook** is sent to AHA backend
3. **AHA receives** the failure notification
4. **Background processing** begins

### **Step 3: AHA Processing**
**What happens:**
1. **AHA backend** receives webhook from LangSmith
2. **LangSmith service** fetches full trace data
3. **Diagnosis service** uses Claude to analyze the failure
4. **GitHub service** creates an issue with the diagnosis
5. **Memory store** saves the incident for the dashboard

### **Step 4: Dashboard Display**
**What happens:**
1. **Frontend** fetches incidents from backend API
2. **Dashboard** displays all detected failures
3. **Users** can see diagnosis, GitHub issues, and trace links

## **üéØ What Each Agent/System Does**

### **Zypher Agent (Target System)**
- **Input:** Research queries like "Find AI trends in healthcare"
- **Process:** Uses Claude to generate comprehensive research reports
- **Output:** Detailed analysis with code examples, strategies, and recommendations
- **Failure Modes:** API errors, timeouts, malformed responses

### **AHA Backend (Healing Agent)**
- **Input:** Webhook notifications from LangSmith
- **Process:** Analyzes traces, diagnoses issues, creates fixes
- **Output:** GitHub issues, incident records, dashboard data
- **Intelligence:** Uses Claude to understand complex failure patterns

### **LangSmith (Observability)**
- **Input:** All agent actions and responses
- **Process:** Records, stores, and organizes execution data
- **Output:** Detailed traces, webhook notifications
- **Value:** Provides the "memory" of what happened

## **ÔøΩÔøΩ Demo Narrative for Hackathon**

**"The Agent That Got Stuck"**

1. **Show the Target System:** "Here's a sophisticated AI research agent built with CoreSpeed's Zypher framework. It can analyze complex queries and generate comprehensive reports."

2. **Demonstrate Normal Operation:** "Let's give it a research task..." (runs successfully)

3. **Introduce the Problem:** "But what happens when AI systems fail? In production, failures are inevitable - API limits, network issues, malformed data..."

4. **Show AHA in Action:** "This is where our Autonomous AI Healing Agent comes in. It monitors the system, detects failures, and autonomously diagnoses and fixes issues."

5. **Display Results:** "Here's the dashboard showing all incidents, with AI-generated diagnoses and GitHub issues created automatically."

**Key Value Proposition:**
- **Autonomous Operations:** AI systems that can heal themselves
- **Real-World Applicability:** Handles actual production failures
- **Enterprise Integration:** Works with existing tools (GitHub, LangSmith)
- **Scalable Solution:** Can monitor any AI system, not just this one

This system demonstrates the future of AI operations - where AI systems are intelligent enough to manage and heal themselves!

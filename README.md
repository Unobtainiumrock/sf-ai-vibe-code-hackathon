# Product Requirements Document: The Autonomous AI Healing Agent ("AHA")

## 1. Overview & Vision

### 1.1. The Vision

To create a "meta-agent" that brings self-healing capabilities to complex, multi-agent AI systems. By observing the operational data of an agentic system in real-time, the Autonomous Healing Agent (AHA) will autonomously detect, diagnose the root cause of, and propose solutions for failures, dramatically reducing debugging time and improving system resilience.

### 1.2. The Problem

Developing and operating sophisticated, multi-agent AI systems is a new frontier fraught with unique challenges. Unlike traditional software, the behavior of these systems is emergent and non-deterministic. When a failure occurs—an agent gets stuck in a loop, misinterprets tool output, or fails to communicate effectively with another agent—diagnosing the issue is a painful, manual process of sifting through logs and traces. There is a critical lack of tooling that can understand the context of a failure and intelligently assist in its resolution.

### 1.3. The Solution

We will build a high-level orchestrator, AHA, that leverages an existing observability platform to monitor a target multi-agent system. When it detects a failure signal (e.g., an error, negative user feedback), it will retrieve the full execution trace, perform a causal analysis using a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), and then take an autonomous action to propose a fix, such as creating a detailed GitHub issue with a root cause analysis and a suggested solution.

## 2. Target Audience

- **AI/ML Engineers & Researchers:** Professionals building, deploying, and maintaining complex agentic systems using frameworks like Zephyr Agents or LangChain.
- **Developers of AI-Powered Applications:** Teams integrating multi-agent workflows into their products who need to ensure reliability and rapid debugging cycles.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Reduce the Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for failures in a complex, multi-agent system.

- **Objective 1 (MVP):** Successfully build a meta-agent (AHA) that can autonomously detect a failure in a separate, monitored agent system.
- **Objective 2 (MVP):** AHA must be able to retrieve the relevant execution trace data from an observability platform via its API.
- **Objective 3 (MVP):** AHA must perform a successful root cause analysis and generate a human-readable diagnosis.
- **Objective 4 (MVP):** AHA must take at least one meaningful, autonomous action, such as creating a well-documented GitHub issue.

**Success Metric:** For a set of predefined, injected faults, AHA correctly identifies and creates a valid GitHub issue for >80% of them.

## 4. Features & Scope (MVP)

The MVP is composed of two main systems: the Target System to be monitored, and the AHA System that performs the monitoring and healing.

### 4.1. The Target System: "Multi-Agent Research Team"

A complex agentic system that will serve as the "patient" for AHA.

**Functionality:** A system that takes a complex research query (e.g., "What are the key technological and ethical challenges of AGI development?") and breaks it down for a team of agents to solve.

**Components:**
- **PlannerAgent:** Decomposes the main query into sub-tasks.
- **ResearcherAgent (x2):** Executes sub-tasks by searching the web (using a tool like Tavily).
- **SynthesizerAgent:** Compiles the results from the researchers into a final, coherent report.

**Instrumentation:** The entire system will be instrumented to log all actions, tool calls, and inter-agent messages as traces to the chosen observability platform.

### 4.2. The Autonomous Healing Agent (AHA) System

The core of the project.

#### Feature 1: Real-Time Failure Detection
- AHA will expose a webhook endpoint.
- This endpoint will be configured in the observability platform to trigger immediately when a trace from the Target System is marked with an error or receives negative user feedback.

#### Feature 2: Causal Diagnosis Engine
- Upon receiving a webhook, AHA retrieves the full trace data for the failed run via the observability platform's API.
- It will then feed this structured data (as JSON) into a powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) using a carefully crafted meta-prompt.
- The prompt will instruct the LLM to act as an expert AI diagnostician, identify the most likely point and reason for failure, and suggest a fix.

#### Feature 3: Autonomous Action: GitHub Issue Creation
- AHA will parse the diagnosis from the LLM.
- It will then use the GitHub API to autonomously create a new issue in a designated repository.
- The issue will be well-structured, including:
  - **Title:** A concise summary of the failure (e.g., "Agent Failure: SynthesizerAgent failed to parse researcher output").
  - **Body:** A detailed report containing the Root Cause Analysis, a link to the full trace in the observability platform, and the LLM's suggested solution.

## 5. Technical Architecture & Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Core Agent Framework:** Zephyr Agents
  - *Usage:* To build the "Multi-Agent Research Team" (Target System). Its advanced orchestration capabilities will create the complex behaviors we aim to monitor.
- **Observability Platform:** LangSmith
  - *Usage:* To capture and store all execution traces from the Target System. Its API is critical for AHA to retrieve data for analysis.
- **Diagnosis LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o or Anthropic Claude 3 Opus
  - *Usage:* The "brain" of the AHA's diagnosis engine, performing the root cause analysis on trace data.
- **Web Framework (for Webhooks):** FastAPI
  - *Usage:* To create the lightweight, asynchronous API endpoint that receives failure notifications from LangSmith.
- **API Integrations:**
  - `langsmith-sdk`: The Python client for interacting with the LangSmith API.
  - `PyGithub` / `requests`: To interact with the GitHub API for issue creation.
- **Environment Management:** Poetry or venv.
- **Hosting:** A simple cloud service capable of running a Python server (e.g., Vercel, Railway, or a small VM) to host the AHA webhook listener.

## 6. User & System Flow

1. **Setup:** A developer instruments their Zephyr-based "Multi-Agent Research Team" with LangSmith environment variables. They configure a LangSmith webhook to point to the deployed AHA endpoint and provide AHA with a GitHub API token.

2. **Execution & Failure:** The Target System runs. An agent encounters an error (e.g., a tool API fails, an LLM call returns malformed JSON that can't be parsed).

3. **Detection:** LangSmith captures the error and automatically sends a payload containing the trace_id to the AHA webhook.

4. **Trigger:** AHA's FastAPI server receives the webhook, acknowledging the request.

5. **Diagnosis:** Asynchronously, AHA uses the trace_id to call the LangSmith API and fetch the full trace. It formats this data and sends it to the Diagnosis LLM.

6. **Action:** AHA receives the analysis back from the LLM. It formats this into a structured report and calls the GitHub API to create a new issue.

7. **Notification:** The developer is notified via GitHub about the new issue, which contains all the information needed to begin debugging, including a link back to the specific failed trace.

## 7. Future Work (Post-MVP)

- **Advanced Repair Actions:** Move beyond issue creation to proposing concrete code or prompt changes in a pull request.
- **Stateful Analysis:** Enhance the diagnosis engine to analyze an agent's memory and state over time, not just a single failed trace.
- **Multi-Agent Visualization:** Develop a simple UI that visualizes the communication patterns between agents in a failed run to more easily spot bottlenecks or loops.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Implement polling mechanisms to detect "soft failures," like degraded quality or high latency, not just hard errors.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: The diagnosis from the LLM may be inaccurate or unhelpful.
**Mitigation:** We will invest heavily in prompt engineering for the meta-prompt. We will also include a confidence score and the full trace link in the GitHub issue so a human can easily verify the findings.

### Risk: Over-reliance on a single observability platform's API.
**Mitigation:** For the MVP, we accept this dependency for speed. Post-MVP, we can design an adapter pattern to support multiple observability backends (e.g., Arize, W&B).

### Risk: Security of API keys (GitHub, LangSmith, OpenAI).
**Mitigation:** We will use secure secret management practices (e.g., environment variables, a secrets manager) and will not hardcode keys.

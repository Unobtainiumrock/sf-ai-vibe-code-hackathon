# Product Requirements Document: The Autonomous AI Healing Agent ("AHA")

**Version:** 1.3 - CoreSpeed Integration  
**Date:** September 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Overview & Vision

### 1.1. The Vision

To create a "meta-agent" that brings self-healing capabilities to complex, multi-agent AI systems. By observing the operational data of an agentic system in real-time, the Autonomous Healing Agent (AHA) will autonomously detect, diagnose the root cause of, and propose solutions for failures, dramatically reducing debugging time and improving system resilience.

**CoreSpeed Integration:** AHA is designed as a core feature of the CoreSpeed platform, transforming it from an AI agent builder into a comprehensive, enterprise-ready operating system for autonomous, self-healing AI workflows.

### 1.2. The Problem

Developing and operating sophisticated, multi-agent AI systems is a new frontier fraught with unique challenges. Unlike traditional software, the behavior of these systems is emergent and non-deterministic. When a failure occurs—an agent gets stuck in a loop, misinterprets tool output, or fails to communicate effectively with another agent—diagnosing the issue is a painful, manual process of sifting through logs and traces.

**For CoreSpeed Users:** This problem is magnified when deploying AI workflows in production. Enterprise clients need reliability guarantees, but current AI agent platforms offer limited operational visibility and no automated failure recovery.

### 1.3. The Solution

We will build AHA as an integrated feature within the CoreSpeed platform. When users deploy AI workflows built with CoreSpeed's no-code agent builder, AHA automatically monitors them for failures. Upon detection, it retrieves execution traces, performs LLM-powered root cause analysis, and takes autonomous healing actions—all within the familiar CoreSpeed interface.

**Strategic Value for CoreSpeed:**
- **Elevates Value Proposition:** From "build AI agents" to "operate reliable, self-healing AI systems"
- **Reduces Total Cost of Ownership:** Automated debugging reduces maintenance overhead for customers
- **Creates Data Flywheel:** Failure patterns improve the platform and agent templates over time
- **Enterprise Differentiation:** Production-ready reliability features that competitors lack

## 2. Demo Narrative: "The Agent That Got Stuck"

### 2.1. The Story We'll Tell

**Scene:** A CoreSpeed customer has deployed a multi-agent research workflow for their marketing team. The system is supposed to research market trends and generate reports, but it's been failing mysteriously for the past 2 hours.

**The Pain Point:** The customer is staring at CoreSpeed's execution logs, trying to figure out why their `SynthesizerAgent` keeps timing out. They've spent 45 minutes manually tracing through the workflow, but the failure is buried in a complex chain of agent interactions. They're about to miss a critical client presentation.

**The Magic Moment:** AHA springs into action! Within 30 seconds of the failure, it:
1. Detects the timeout in the SynthesizerAgent
2. Analyzes the full execution trace
3. Identifies that the ResearcherAgent is returning malformed JSON
4. Creates a GitHub issue with the exact fix needed
5. Updates the CoreSpeed "Agent Health" dashboard showing the incident and resolution

**The Resolution:** The customer sees the GitHub notification directly in their CoreSpeed workspace, applies the suggested fix (adding JSON validation), and their workflow is back online in minutes instead of hours.

### 2.2. Demo Flow (CoreSpeed Integration)

1. **Setup (30 seconds):** Show the CoreSpeed agent builder with AHA enabled
2. **Deploy Workflow (15 seconds):** Deploy the multi-agent research workflow
3. **Show Normal Operation (15 seconds):** Workflow runs successfully

## 13. Technical Implementation Notes

### 13.1. Zypher Agent Integration

Our target system is built using [CoreSpeed's Zypher Agent framework](https://zypher.corespeed.io/docs/quick-start), which provides several key advantages:

**Native CoreSpeed Ecosystem:**
- Uses CoreSpeed's proprietary agent framework
- Leverages Zypher's built-in LLM providers and MCP servers
- Seamless integration with CoreSpeed's existing infrastructure

**Multi-Agent Architecture:**
```typescript
// Example Zypher Agent setup for our research team
const agent = new ZypherAgent(
  new AnthropicModelProvider({
    apiKey: getRequiredEnv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
  }),
);

// Register MCP servers for external capabilities
await agent.mcpServerManager.registerServer({
  id: "firecrawl",
  type: "command",
  command: {
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
    env: { FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: getRequiredEnv("FIRECRAWL_API_KEY") },
  },
});
```

**Instrumentation Strategy:**
- Zypher agents instrumented with LangSmith for observability
- Custom error injection for demo failure scenarios
- Real-time event streaming that AHA can monitor

### 13.2. Why This Matters for CoreSpeed

Using Zypher Agent (not the open-source Zephyr) makes our project a **direct enhancement** to CoreSpeed's platform:

1. **Product Integration**: AHA becomes a natural extension of Zypher's capabilities
2. **Strategic Alignment**: We're enhancing their proprietary technology, not building on competitors
3. **Customer Value**: CoreSpeed customers get immediate benefit from AHA's healing capabilities
4. **Technical Synergy**: Leverages existing Zypher infrastructure and patterns

This positions AHA as a **core product feature** rather than an external tool, making it much more valuable to CoreSpeed's roadmap and customer success.
